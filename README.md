### kiwi-beta
![Build](https://github.com/sleberknight/kiwi-beta/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)

A playground for experimental code that might or might not ever make it into [kiwi](https://github.com/kiwiproject/kiwi)
or [kiwi-test](https://github.com/kiwiproject/kiwi-test).

All code is annotated with the Google Guava `@Beta` annotation to make it clear that none of this is intended as
anything other than experimental code that is subject to change at any time, and for any reason, etc.
